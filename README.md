[b]About[/b]

We are building tasko.io – a fully decentralized, blockchain-based outsourcing platform with an integrated end-to-end quality assurance process. 

Tasko.io allows companies to outsource digital tasks with a significantly higher cost-effectiveness compared to existing platforms: The tasko.io platform’s freelancers manage the entire outsourcing process, from task analysis to task delivery. A multi-level review structure ensures high quality levels along the Task Completion Cycle. Freelancers benefit from the platform’s decentralized nature – they receive approximately 97% of the platform’s revenue. 

To achieve this, tasko.io leverages the Ethereum network and blockchain, decentralized database solutions and Tasko’s proprietary matching algorithms. Smart contracts are the platform’s backbone, allowing for a friction-less and to a growing extent, automated interaction between all platform actors. 

The most important freelancer (e.g. ratings), task and client data get stored on the Blockchain – anonymously and immutably. The platform’s own TSK tokens allow for an efficient exchange of value on the platform and lay the foundation for an effective long-term incentivization of different platform actors.
